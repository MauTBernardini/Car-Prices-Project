# Car-Prices-Project
This project has two main objectives: 
  1. Predict car prices based on categorical and continous features given by a public dataset of Kaggle given by `car_prices.csv`. It aims to explore pre-processing techniques and predictors comparison and can be found on ``Projeto_Car_Prices.ipynb`
  2. Give an profiling inteface to discover data easily through streamlit.

**Disclaimer:** There's a lot to keep improving in both topics, specially second one. That improvements may include DBT and Great Expectations, for instance.


 ## 1. Insatallation
 This section covers Windows installation

1. Be positive you have your python installed and git configured :)
2. `pip install virtualenv`
3. `python3.10 -m venv .venv-name`
4. `.venv-name\Scripts\activate.bat`
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`



## 2. Execution

1. To execute the streamlit application just activate the venv and go to the project root path and type
- `streamlit run profiling.py`
- open the localhost port indicated

2. The prediction study can be seen in the jupyter notebook. Since you have it all installed in you venv, I suggest configuring VSCode with jupyter extension.


## 3.Details 
This section will explain further the project structure for both objectives: (1) and (2).

(2) **Profiling Data with Streamlit**
